# better_ebirdAPI 

This python package was created for a Concordia Univeristy Geog464: Programming for Geospatial technologies class. The package is made for birders using the ebirdAPI. 
A tutorial on the package can be found in the .ipynd file "using_btter_ebirdAPI_tutorial". The .ipynd file "btter_ebirdAPI_tutorial" is a walk through on the creations of the packages functions. 

Some of the functions require a google API key but they are not necessary if the user doesn't have one.
